Files Temp_GUI.py and Temp_GUI1.py successfully read in temperature data from labjack U3. 

The buttons on the GUI Do as follows: 

Start: Starts reading and plotting temperature data. 

Stop: Stops the plot. 

Clear: clears data, which allows to restart the plotting without needed to close the interface. 

To Do: 

Need to add axis titles.

Figure out x axis scale and change it to time. 

Add menu system so that one can save the plot. 

Maybe figure out how to add fitting (long term)
